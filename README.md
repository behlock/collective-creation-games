### Collective Creation Games
Collective Creation Games is an attempt to visualise knowledge through the use of a 3D Force Graph that can be filtered and gradually explored.

While regular note taking apps are great for capturing thoughts, they are not so great for visualising and exploring them.

The objective was to make the findings of a social experiment accessible and interesting to discover. Think about it as a dark map that's ready to be explored.
